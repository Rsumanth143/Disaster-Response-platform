# Disaster-Response-platform
This project is a backend-heavy MERN stack application designed to help manage and coordinate disaster response operations. It provides a system to log disasters, extract location data using Al (Google Gemini API), map geolocations, monitor social media for real-time updates, and fetch official disaster alerts.
